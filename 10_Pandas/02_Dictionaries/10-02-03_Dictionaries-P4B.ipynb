The only types of data we are allowed to use as keys are strings and numbers4 , so we can’t, for example, create a dictionary where the keys are file objects. Values can be whatever type of data we like. Also, keys must be unique – we can’t store multiple values for the same key. You might think that this makes dicts less useful, but there are ways round the problem of storing multiple values – we won’t need them for the examples in this chapter, but the chapter on complex data structures in Advanced Python for Biologists gives details.\n",

You’ll notice that while the set of trinucleotides is the same, the order in which they appear is different. This illustrates an important point about dictionaries – they are inherently unordered. That means that when we use the keys method to iterate over a dictionary, we can’t rely on processing the items in the same order that we added them. This is in contrast to lists, which always maintain the same order when looping. If we want to control the order in which keys are printed we can use the sorted method to sort the list before processing it:\n",
