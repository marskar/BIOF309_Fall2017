Course
Description
------------------

This course is designed for non-programmers,
biologists, or those without specific knowledge of python to learn how to
program.
Week by week we will slowly build up your skills and understanding of
programming and the python language. As with learning
any language you will get
as much out of this class as you put in more effort. There will be in class
demonstrations and
Homework most weeks for you to practice and learn at your own
pace.


Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this course you
should be able to:

1. Look at a task and determine if you can or should
automate it
2. Create working python programs
3. Understand the difference
between different object types in python (i.e. lists, dicts)
4. Do basic data
analysis with python
5. Write bioinformatics programs utilizing the biopython
package

Logistics
---------

This is a one-semester course starting on the 11th
of September 2017, and finishing on 18th of December 2017.

* Meeting Time and
Place: 5:30 Section - Rathskeller, Building 60, NIH Bethesda campus
* Meeting
Time and Place: 7:30 Section - Rathskeller, Building 60, NIH Bethesda campus
Attendance in class is strongly recommended; however, we realize other
commitments will occasionally prevent attendance. 
If you miss a class, please
review the materials available at the course [github
repository](https://github.com/marskar/BIO309_Fall2017).

You may only attend
the section for which you signed up. Do **NOT** attend other sections **UNLESS**
given premission to do so by the instructor.

Most classes will have hands-on
tutorials and assignments. Both practice and graded assignments will generally
be
provided. Graded assignments should be submitted prior to the following
class.
So that you can follow along during class bringing a laptop to each class
is
strongly encouraged.

Important dates:
* September 11 : Class starts
*
September 11 - September 29 : Late Registration ($10.00 late registration fee
per course applies)
* October 6 : Last day to drop/withdraw
* November 10 : Last
day to change status (credit or audit)
* December 18 : Class ends

Required
Materials
------------------

**Each student is encouraged to bring their own
laptop to each class.** *Programing without a computer would be an exceptional
feat.*

For the course, we will use Python 3. Any python installation should
work, but you
must be able to install packages. The [Anaconda Scientific Python
Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) from Continuum Analytics will
likely be the easiest approach to configuring python if you do not already have
python installed. The Anaconda installer will automatically install many of the
packages we will use during the course. Or see the guidelines on
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/ that were emailed to you.

Recommended
Books
-----------------

**There is no required textbook for this course.**

We
do, however, highly recommend [Python for Data
Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) and its companion
text [A Whirlwind Tour of
Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython). Both books are
available free on GitHub in Jupyter Notebook form. For maximum enjoyment,
consider reading the relevant chapters before coming to class.

We will link to
relevant online resources throughout the course.

If you would like additional
material on the basics, the following resources may be useful:

* [Python for
Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/) by Martin Jones; an archived PDF
may be found in this repo p4b.pdf.
* [Learn python the hard way (ebook freely
available from the author)](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed A.
Shaw; a video course is also [available](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/).
*
[Think python (ebook freely available from the
author)](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html) by Allen B.
Downey.
* [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3 (ebook freely
available from the author)](https://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php) by Charles
Severance
* [Python
Cookbook](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000393/index.html) by
David Beazy

Assignments and Grading
-----------------------

The emphasis of the course is on learning and mastering
the skills covered. It is my hope that everyone will be able to complete the
assignments and project. If some of the material appears unclear please ask for
clarification.

Assignments will be uploaded to the
[DropItTo.me](http://www.DropItTo.me) website. Links will be given in each class
material.

Grading __assignments__ will follow the following rubric:

* Program
runs, produces correct result, contains useful comments, meaningful variable
names, follows coding conventions: A+
* Program runs, produces correct result,
contains useful comments: A
* Program runs, produces something close to the
correct result: B
* Program runs, does not produce correct result: C
* Program
does not run: Incomplete (I)


Grading the __final project__ will follow the
following rubric:

* Project description / Specification

  - Goals unclear,
difficulty demonstrating functionality (1-3)
  - Goals for the project and
functionality are discussed but difficult to follow (4-6)
  - Goals for the
project and functionality are discussed (7-9)
  - Goals for the project and
functionality are logically presented and clearly communicated (10-12)


*
Documentation

  - Only comments embedded in the code (1-3)
  - Objects and
methods have docstrings (4-6)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings,
additional standalone documentation (7-9)

Readability

  - The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read (1-3)
-
The code is readable, but challenging to understand (4-6)
