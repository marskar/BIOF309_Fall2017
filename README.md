Course Description
------------------

This course is designed for non-programmers,
biologists, or those without specific knowledge of python to learn how to program.
Week by week we will slowly build up your skills and understanding of programming and the python language. As with learning any language you will get as much out of this
class as you put in more effort. There will be in class
demonstrations,using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html), activities to be completed outside of class, mostly using [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), and homework for you to practice and learn at your own pace.


Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this course you should be able to:
1. Look at a task and determine if you can or should automate it
2. Create working python programs
3. Understand the difference between different object types in python (i.e. lists, dicts)
4. Do basic data analysis with python

Logistics
---------

This is a one-semester course starting on the 11th
of September 2017 and finishing on 18th of December 2017.

* Meeting Time and Place: 5:30 Section - Rathskeller, Building 60, NIH Bethesda campus
* Meeting Time and Place: 7:30 Section - Rathskeller, Building 60, NIH Bethesda campus

Attendance in class is strongly recommended; however, we realize other
commitments will occasionally prevent attendance.
If you miss a class, please review the materials available at the course [github
repository](https://github.com/marskar/BIO309_Fall2017).

You may only attend the section for which you signed up. Do **NOT** attend other sections **UNLESS** given permission to do so by the instructor.

Most classes will have hands-on tutorials and assignments. Both practice and graded assignments will generally be provided. Graded assignments should be submitted prior to the following class.
So that you can follow along during class, bringing a laptop to each class is strongly encouraged.

Important dates:
* September 11 : Class starts
* September 11 - September 29 : Late Registration ($10.00 late registration fee
per course applies)
* October 6 : Last day to drop/withdraw
* November 10 : Last day to change status (credit or audit)
* December 18 : Class ends

Required Materials
------------------

**Each student is encouraged to bring their own
laptop to each class.**

*Programing without a computer would be an exceptional
feat.*

For the course, we will use Python 3. Any python installation should
work, but you
must be able to install packages. The [Anaconda Scientific Python
Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) from Continuum Analytics will
likely be the easiest approach to configuring python if you do not already have
python installed. The Anaconda installer will automatically install many of the
packages we will use during the course. Or see the guidelines on
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/ that were emailed to you.



Optional Materials
------------------

[GitHub](https://github.com) is offering some awesome resources, that
might be interesting you you depending on your background: [GitHub student
pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

In particular, [atom](https://atom.io) is noteworthy
because of its [integration with GitHub](https://github.atom.io/),
ability to offer Jupyter Notebook style functionality through packages like Hydrogen and jupyter-notebook.


Recommended Books
-----------------
**There is no required textbook for this course.**

We do, however, highly recommend [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) and its companion
text [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython).
Both books are available free on GitHub in Jupyter Notebook form.
For maximum enjoyment,
consider reading the relevant chapters before coming to class.

We will link to
relevant online resources throughout the course.

If you would like additional
material on the basics, the following resources may be useful:

* [Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/) by Martin Jones; an archived PDF
may be found in this repo in the extras folder under the name p4b.pdf.
* [Learn python the hard way (ebook freely available from the author)](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed A. Shaw; a [video course](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) is also available.
* [Think python (ebook freely available from the author)](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html) by Allen B.
Downey.
* [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3 (ebook freely available from the author)](https://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php) by Charles Severance
* [Python Cookbook](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000393/index.html) by
David Beazy
For more information about python, please see the official Python
Software Foundation website at https://www.python.org/

Assignments and Grading
-----------------------

The emphasis of the course is on learning and mastering
the skills covered. It is my hope that everyone will be able to complete the
assignments and project. If some of the material appears unclear, please ask for
clarification.

Assignments will be uploaded to the GitHub classroom setup for the course.

Grading __assignments__ will be done using the following rubric:

* Program runs, produces correct result, contains useful comments, meaningful variable names, follows coding conventions: A+
* Program runs, produces correct result, contains useful comments: A
* Program runs, produces something close to the correct result: B
* Program runs, does not produce correct result: C
* Program does not run: Incomplete (I)

Grading the __final project__ will be done using the following rubric:

* Project description / Specification

  - Goals unclear, difficulty demonstrating functionality (1-3)
  - Goals for the project and functionality are discussed but difficult to follow (4-6)
  - Goals for the project and functionality are discussed (7-9)
  - Goals for the project and functionality are logically presented and clearly communicated (10-12)

* Documentation

  - Only comments embedded in the code (1-3)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings (4-6)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings, additional standalone documentation (7-9)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings, extensive standalone documentation with example usage (10-12)

* Readability

  - The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read (1-3)
  - The code is readable, but challenging to understand (4-6)
  - The code is fairly easy to read (7-9)
  - The code is well organized and very easy to read (10-12)

* Reusability

  - The code is not organized for reusability (1-3)
  - Some parts of the code could be reused (4-6)
  - Most of the code could be reused (7-9)
  - Each part of the code, and the whole, could be reused (10-12)

* Performance

  - Program does not run (1-6)
  - Program runs, but does not produce correct output (7-12)
  - Program runs, produces correct output under most conditions (13-18)
  - Program runs, produces correct output with robust error checking (19-24)
