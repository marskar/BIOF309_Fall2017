In section 2, we used string manipulation tools to process single sequences, and in section 3, we practised reading and writing files one at a time. The closest we got to using multiple pieces of data was during the final exercise in section 3, where we were dealing with three DNA sequences.\n",

In fact, there’s a good chance that you’re working through this course because you want to be able to write programs to help you deal with large datasets. A very common situation in biological research is to have a large collection of data (DNA sequences, SNP positions, gene expression measurements) that all need to be processed in the same way. In this section, we’ll learn about the fundamental programming tools that will allow our programs to do this.\n",

        "The limitations of this approach became clear quite quickly as we looked at the solution code – it only worked because the number of sequences were small, and we knew the number in advance. If we were to repeat the exercise with three hundred or three thousand sequences, the vast majority of the code would be given over to storing variables and it would become completely unmanageable. And if we were to try and write a program that could process an unknown number of input sequences (for instance, by reading them from a file), we wouldn’t be able to do it. To make our programs able to process multiple pieces of data, we need an entirely new type of structure which can hold many pieces of information at the same time – a list.\n",

It’s the exact same notation that we used to get substrings back in section 2, and it works in exactly the same way – numbers are inclusive at the start and exclusive at the end. The fact that we use the same notation for strings and lists hints at a deeper relationship between the two types. In fact, what we were doing when extracting substrings in section 2 was treating a string as though it were a list of characters. This idea – that we can treat a variable as though it were a list when it’s not – is a powerful one in Python and we’ll come back to it later in this section (and also in the chapter on iterators in Advanced Python for Biologists)."

In contrast, when we create a variable to be used in a loop, we don’t set its value – the value of the variable will be automatically set to each element of the list in turn, and it will be different each time round the loop.\n",

Well, for one thing, there’s much less redundancy – here we only needed to write two print statements. This also means that if we need to make a change to the code, we only have to make it once rather than three separate times. Another benefit of using a loop here is that if we want to add some elements to the list, we don’t have to touch the loop code at all. Consequently, it doesn’t matter how many elements are in the list, and it’s not a problem if we don’t know how many are going to be in it at the time when we write the code. Many problems that can be solved with loops can also be solved using a tool called list comprehensions – see the chapter on comprehensions in Advanced Python for Biologists."
